# 7 days to die mods

Some mods I've made to make the game different for single player mode. If you not sure what game I'm referring to you can check it out on [steam](https://go.beeming.net/2MD7eJn).

## Carry More

Using a 'base' mod of [S420_SimpleUI-BiggerBackpack120-PlayerBuiltStorage](https://github.com/stedman420/Simple_UI_Modlets/tree/master/S420_SimpleUI-BiggerBackpack120-PlayerBuiltStorage) which gives you 120 spaces in your backpack this mod will let you use alls the spaces without needing pack mule or crafting pockets.

## Stack 15000

If you are just exploring it's great to be able to stack a bunch more than normal, using this mod that bunch is 15000 so you never have to 'waste' extra storage space on your adventures.

## The Flash

Sometimes you don't want to build a base and be settled in, this mod lets you run really fast... be careful not to break your leg running over a hill ðŸ˜‹.
